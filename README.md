# Machine Learning Engineer

#### Technical Skills: Python, Huggingface, Gen AI, Deep Learning

## Work Experience
**Work Student @ Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR),  Würselen (_October 2023 – April 2025_)**
- Implemented generative machine learning models: Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), Variational Auto Encoder (VAE) and Diffusion models, for generating realistic artificial material test data.
- Models implemented using Pytorch as the framework.
- The artificially generated data were used to augment the training dataset for material property prediction.
- Experience in containerization of packages using docker.


**Product Engineer  @ Indian Space Research Organization, Trivandrum (_September 2015 – September 2022_)**
- Designed and developed composite optical structures and solar panels for space missions including Indian Lunar Mission, Chandrayan-2.
